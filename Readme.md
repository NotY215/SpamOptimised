## 🚀 Overview
**Spam Optimised** is a cutting-edge Fabric mod designed to provide a "perfect" combat experience. Unlike standard auto-clickers, this mod uses packet-level logic to ensure **Maximum Power** (Critical Hits) on every strike while remaining undetected by most modern anti-cheats.

### 💎 Key Features
* **Auto-Crit Engine:** Automatically spoofs movement packets to force critical hits even when you are standing still.
* **Dynamic CPS Control:** Adjustable slider (1-20 CPS) to mimic human-like speed or maximum devastation.
* **Smart Targeting:** The mod only activates when your crosshair is focused on a player, preventing accidental hits.
* **In-Game Menu:** Seamless GUI integration via **ModMenu** and **Cloth Config**.
* **Zero-Damage Anchor PVP:** Automated shielding logic to protect you from your own anchor explosions.

## 🕹️ PVP Modes
The mod adapts its logic based on the weapon you are holding:

| Mode | Logic Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sword/Axe** | Standard spam with forced critical hit packets. |
| **Mace** | Intelligent Smash: Only triggers attacks when fall distance is > 1.5 blocks for maximum smash damage. |
| **Crystal** | Automated Obsidian placement, Crystal mounting, and instant explosion logic. |
| **Anchor** | Places a protection block on your side, places the Anchor, charges with Glowstone, and explodes. |
| **Bow** | Auto-release: Replaces the arrow the millisecond the bow reaches maximum charge. |
